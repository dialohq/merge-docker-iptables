# merge-docker-iptables
A utility to merge statically defined iptables with dynamic rules generated by docker 

Currently closed source to make contribution simpler for our team. Let us know in an issue if you want to have it open sourced.

Usage:
```sh
# Assuming ./iptables.rules.current is a file containing static iptables rules
iptables-save > iptables.dynamic
docker run \
  -v $(pwd)/iptables.rules.current:/iptables.saved \
  -v $(pwd)/iptables.dynamic:/iptables.dynamic \
  --rm \
  ghcr.io/dialohq/merge-docker-iptables:sha-3df0f51 /iptables.saved /iptables.dynamic
```

The merged iptables will be printed to stdout.
